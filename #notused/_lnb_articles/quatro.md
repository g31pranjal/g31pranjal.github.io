So, Microsoft it is ! Facing 14 interviews in a day, sleeping at 4 just to get up again at 6, taking 3 rejections, sitting in an interview for almost 2 hrs... I had my taste of placements, and what's more could I have asked than to get an offer from one of the companies I really approved of. 

Frankly, I didn't expected such play of events.
