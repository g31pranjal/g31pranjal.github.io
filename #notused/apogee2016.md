The idea of the website is, by way, inspired by the opening credits scene of the popular HBO television series **"Silicon Valley"**. Being, inspired by the idea of a moving city, we were excited in putting it together as a navigable map in orthogonal view. We paly played a lot with 'setting up' the entire city on the website which features different attractions of the fest as clickable buildings placed on the city. Clicking on them opens a lightbox for further information or induces an action. 

We have used a pan-and-zoom library for operating functionalities on the map. The entire graphics is done in Vector and completely by us.
