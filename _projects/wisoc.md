*I am currently working on this project at <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/WebIntelligenceandSocialComputingLab" target="_blank">Web Intelligence and Social Computing (WISoc) Lab</a> at BITS Pilani, under the guidence of <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/poonam/profile" target="_blank"> Dr. Poonam Goyal</a>*. 

Image captioning is clearly one of the most extensively explored topics in the recent past using the established and recently reported techniques of Neural Networks. Several network architectures have been reported in the past few years and betterment is still inevitable on this. 

My research work is to give an alternate model for image captioning using a particular non-conventional approach in architecture.
