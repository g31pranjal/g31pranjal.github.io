*I am currently working under <a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~kleung/" target="_blank">Dr. Carson kai-Sang Leung</a> in the Database and data mining lab at University of Manitoba, Canada for the summer of 2017.* 

We are trying to design a framework that can perform space and time optimizations while frequent-pattern mining on large datasets. Our approach uses the principles of ECLAT, DECLAT and VIPER algorithms for vertically mining the datasets.
