Based on the theme, The 90s' show, the website is inspired by the interactive resume of <a href="http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/" target="_blank">Robby Leonardi</a>
. Done in a team of 9, 6 designers and 3 frontend developers, the project was our first exposure to creating a professional website of such magnitude. 

<img style="width: 100%;padding: 4%" src="/assets/img/proj-oasis14-1.png" />
The website depicts the journey of a character as it passes through various scenes (7 viz. desert, farm, city, carnival,  underwater, beach, and finally, cave) and discovers the elements that have quite literally, occupied our childhood. It also incorporates a game, wherein user needs to answer questions and click on hidden references in the entire journey to gain points. Being the last generation to have witnessed the 90s', we have tried to repaint the whole picture as a journey which is sure to give the nostalgia of the era gone by. 

We have used skrollr.js to create a multi-layer parallax in the background, wherein 3 layers (2 behind the character and 1 in front of character) are emulated as div containers that hold objects in each scene and slides relative to each other as the character "moves". The movement of the character is false; only the surroundings move ! We have taken css animation referneces from varied sources  ( codepen.io, jsfiddle.net ) and used at multiple instances in the website. Graphics are inspired by their corresponding references and is recreated entirely by us, being done in vector and rasterized to HD resolution.
