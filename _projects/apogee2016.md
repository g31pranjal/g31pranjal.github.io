The idea is, by way, inspired by the opening graphics of a popular HBO television series **"Silicon Valley"**. Being, inspired by the idea of a moving city, we were excited in it putting together as a navigable map in orthogonal view. Having played a lot with 'setting up' the city, it features different attractions of the fest as clickable buildings placed on the city. Clicking on them opens a lightbox for further information or induces an action. 

We have used a pan-and-zoom library for operating functionalities on the map. The entire graphics is done in Vector and completely by us.
