They say it's all land of free... free to dream, work, live and prosper. I couldn't have find a more apt way to describe what just gone by past me. Never did I expect the way things have been for me in this awe-inspiring country, yet a large part of my experience are from the people I met. 



I would always remember Canada to give me an awesome opportunity to think of what I need to do in mind, plan out my line of action, become independent in my thoughts and endeavours. Above all, It gave me the courage to move forth, alone, and instilled in me the lost confidence that will definitely play alongside me :)
