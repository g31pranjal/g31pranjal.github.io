I met Swikriti in most unexpected way during initial days of my stay in Canada. A Reginan, not so forthcoming, but definitely more than reserved, this girl was quick to make hers and mine intentions straight. Already, she had taken me aback by her 'witty responses'. It didn't take long for us to realise that we do have some kind of compatibility when it comes to serious 'life' talks, having spent hours and days.

Rest put aside, the thing that did infatuated me was her simplicity. Imagine a person being engrossed in living her life so completely that it hardly leaves her to think of what's gone by. I dismissed the notion as ignorance... but then I did realised that maybe, this is the simplest way of living! "Find happiness in people, things and actions", it was effortless and transparent for her, rather than dwelling in past. Being happy and satisfied is the goal in life, and it can be through simplest of thing, no need for a moonshot. It's irrelevant and worthless to linger over a thing if that doesn't pacify you... while, pretty useful being close to things that do affect your life. You see, all you need to do is "keep your sources of happiness close-by"!.. 

She didn't stay long in Winnipeg. Parting was indeed difficult - deep down we knew that we will not be meeting anytime soon, but yet glad we met. It's strange how the most unfamiliar of people can have the most profound effect in you.

**--- To Swikriti**

"I want you to be close forever. Once again, I want to be awed by your simplicity and maybe, you find my talks interesting even then. Fast forward 2025, let's just hope one of our reunion hypothesis turns out real!"
