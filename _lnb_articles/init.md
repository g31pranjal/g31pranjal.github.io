I always wanted to be vocal. Contrary to what I tried to be, I've always found myself being reserved, quiet and secretive. Most of the times, it is a constant struggle between the two perspective, in which the later prevails... just to make way for a detailed retrospective analysis of why I couldn't be expressive, at least to a magnitude of my scale. Needless to say, the results are more than often unclear. 

But then at the back of the mind there is this little seed of thought that says,  "Why do you have to be expressive ?!". Profuse reasons draw to head but none necessarily appeals to concise. Perhaps, that's how I function... after all, each one of us, with little traits of economist, decides our own priorities.
