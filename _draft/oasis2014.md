# Oasis 2014 : That 90's show 

#### The main website for the 2014 edition of the cultural festival of BITS Pilani.

Based on the theme, The 90s' show, the website is inspired by the interactive resume of [Robby Leonardi](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/). Done in a team of 9, 6 designers and 3 frontend developers, the project was our first exposure to creating a professional website of such magnitude. 

The website depicts the journey of a character as it passes through various scenes (7 viz. desert, farm, city, carnival,  underwater, beach, and finally, cave) as he discovers the elements that comprises our cultural fest. It also incorporated a game, wherein user needs to answer questions and click on hidden references in the entire journey to gain points.

We used skrollr.js to create a multi-layer parallax in the background, wherein 3 layers (2 behind the character and 1 in front of character) are emulated as div containers that hold objects in the scene and slides relative to each other as the character "moves". Graphics was done in vector and rasterized to HD resolution.
